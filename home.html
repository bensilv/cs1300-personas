            <p>In this project I've set out to learn how different people use microwaves to better understand the interface

            <p>Microwaves allow people to quickly heat up or reheat food. They also offer many presets and other functions
             such as defrosting and a timer. Users can open the door and place their food inside. Next they either
              type in a time or select a preset or the 30 second button, and
            then click the start button to cook their food. The screen counts down the time left.</p>

            <p>After users used the microwave, they were asked the following questions so I could better understand
            their experience:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>On a scale of 1-5 (new user to expert), how experienced are you with microwaves?</li>
              <li>On a scale of 1-5 rate your confidence cooking food in a microwave.</li>
              <li>What do you use the microwave for?</li>
              <ol>
                <li>If you use the microwave with food, what food?</li>
              </ol>
              <li>What can you use the microwave for?</li>
              <ol>
                <li>If there are features you know about but don't use: why do you not use these other capabilities of the microwave?</li>
              </ol>
              <li>On a scale of 1-5 how easy was using this microwave? (Super Hard -> Super Easy)</li>
              <ol>
                <li>Why did you make the selection you did?</li>
              </ol>
              <li>How did you use the microwave from start to finish?</li>
              <ol>
                <li>How did you decide on these actions?</li>
                <li>If you were to use the microwave again for this task, would you perform these same actions or do them differently?</li>
              </ol>
              <li>How did you know when you could retrieve your food?</li>
              <li>How effective was the handle?</li>
              <li>What does each button on the microwave do?</li>
              <ol>

                <ol><li>Why do you use these buttons the most?</li></ol>
              </ol>
              <ol>

                <ol><li>Why do you use these buttons the least?</li></ol>
              </ol>
              <li>What can or did you do to turn off the microwave?</li>
              <li>How did you decide how long to microwave this item?</li>
              <ol><li>On a scale of 1-5 how confident were you in this choice?</li></ol>
              <li>Did the food come out as expected?</li>
              <li>On a scale of 1-5, (never to every time) how often do items come out of the microwave as expected?</li>
              <ol><li>If not 5: How do you handle when items come out in some unexpected way?</li></ol>

            <p>I chose 3 people to observe using the microwave, after which I asked them the above questions and recorded my observations.</p>
